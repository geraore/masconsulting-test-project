# masconsulting-test-project
Hello everyone, if you get to this point whether you are technical examiner from MAS Global or you are just curios to see several django components interacting in one single project.

For this repository I will be using the following:

#### Language and framework
* Python 3.7
* Django xx 
* 

#### Data Layer
* sqlite3

#### Security
I will also implement some basic security to consume the services with an api key / user pwd


The final products for this repo will be:
* A data layer
* Some web services consumption
* Some exposed web services 
* A basic web page 

So as you can see I will be showing the MVC model in its full glory with the DJANGO framework.

PD: Since this is a showcase repo, I will be using the master branch for absolutely everything so don't judge me ;)
